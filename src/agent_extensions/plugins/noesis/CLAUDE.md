# Noesis plugin — design rules

Layered on `src/agent_extensions/CLAUDE.md` and `SDLC/CLAUDE.md`. Only the noesis-specific delta is captured here.

## Models

- **Skill output**: each skill has a `{SkillName}Output` Zod schema at `shared-contracts/skills/<skill>/output.ts`. Skills that build a result incrementally persist it as `<working_dir>/output.json` and edit it in place across steps.
- **UI read models**: each page has `{PageName}Data` — backend at `mcp/noesis-graph/ui-data/<page>/<page>-data.ts` exposed via `/api/ui/<page>`; UI mirrors the type at `ui/src/<page>/<page>-data.ts` (Vite can't import from the backend tree). Assemble what the page needs server-side, one fetch per page when possible.
- **Shared contracts**: top-level `shared-contracts/` holds cross-skill, cross-domain models grouped by domain; `shared-contracts/skills/<skill>/` holds skill-specific output and helpers. Reuse a top-level model whenever it fits as-is.
- **Type minimalism**: prefer passing a bit too much data over introducing a new type. Aliases and structural shapes beat fresh interfaces when the shape already exists.

## Architecture

- **Repositories**: granular DB ops only (`exists`, `insertX`, `linkX`, `updateXFields`). Used **only by services** — never from MCP handlers, controllers, or other repositories.
- **Services**: orchestrate use cases — read+validate input, decompose into a sequence of repository calls, compose across same-domain repositories. The only callers of repositories.
- **MCP tools / HTTP controllers**: thin — parse args, call a service method, shape the response.
- **One step → one struct → one MCP tool**: each workflow step gets a single dedicated structure returned by a single tool. Avoid chatty round-trips.
- **Minimal returns**: return only what the agent or UI needs next. `{ status: "Ok" }` or `{ id }` is fine; per-slot breakdowns usually aren't.

## Boundaries

- **No LLM in the MCP server**: `noesis-graph` has no Anthropic API access. All semantic reasoning (Goldilocks topic search, summarisation, decision/design extraction) happens in the agent driving the skill. The server provides deterministic data access only.
